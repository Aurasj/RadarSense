# RadarSense

Real-time radar gesture recognition system built with the Acconeer A111 radar sensor and a TinyCNN-based classification pipeline.

RadarSense combines radar signal acquisition, machine learning inference, gesture stabilization, and a live web dashboard into a single end-to-end system.

---

## Features

* Real-time gesture recognition
* TinyCNN inference engine
* FSM-based gesture stabilization
* Live radar waveform visualization
* Live waterfall/heatmap visualization
* Session statistics and event logging
* UDP gesture event broadcasting
* Raspberry Pi + Acconeer A111 integration
* Model evaluation report dashboard

---

## Supported Gestures

The current model recognizes the following classes:

* none
* hold
* push
* pull
* tap
* wave
